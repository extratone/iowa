# Drywall Video: "TEECH"

Wearing leather jacket in a classroom, sitting in very back row feet resting on desk in front, ridiculous poses.

One look and you know this guy smells like cat litter, sun-rotted vinyl and cigarettes.

Alternatively he could be dressed in something completely out of place (overalls, rusted bedpan strapped to chest, kerchief on his head but it's tied perpendicular to his face.)

Teacher is trying to give a lecture and our lovely protagonist repeatedly interrupts with phrases like:Â 

"HEY YO TEECH, YOU VAPE? GOT MINE RIGHT HEAAA"

"HEY TEECH, BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVERNAH RON PAUL. YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY IS GOIN TO SHIT."

"YO TEECH, WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THIS CAGE ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK:" (cut)

"COME ONNNNNNNNNN TEECH, I CAN'T BE PUT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT LABELS. RON PAL"

"YO TEECH THIS IS SOME BULLSHIT"

while making ridiculous hand gestures with the gun hand, nearly falling out of chair.

Actually falls out of chair and starts screaming the same stuff at the ground

Teacher either doesn't react or is just like "will you please shut the fuck up."

Rest of the class stares stoically and unwaveringly at the front wall of the room for the entire thing.
