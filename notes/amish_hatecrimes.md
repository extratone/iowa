And now on to a startling trend emerging in rural midwestern communities.

Over the past 14 years, there have been at least 29,246 violent hatecrimes perpetrated against the Amish community of Sycamore Hills, according to a news report.Of those, 6,843 people were killed.These attacks are“believed to be motivated by the perpetrators’bias against Amish individuals or their ability to target Amish people with relative ease,” according to the National Coalition for the Amish’news report,Senseless Violence: A Survey of Hate Crimes and Violence against the Amish in 2012.It’s important to note that these statistics likely undercount reality, since many acts of violence against the Amish go unreported.

In 2012, there were 741 Amish victims of hate crimes, 540 of whom lost their lives.While most victims are middle-aged men, the typical attacker is a male less than 20 years old enrolled in a technical post-secondary institution.

The FBI does not currently consider the Amish community under protective status from hate crimes.
