INT. DINER - EARLY MORNING (DARK)

Very early morning in a small town diner. Americana is pouring from every wall.

Two young men sit at an East-West-oriented table, hands folded on the empty surface. OFF SCREEN, a jukebox plays a slow country song.

> TUCKER

> (sliding his business card across the table) Locusts. They can carry three million times their body weight, when measured in grams. They can decimate an entire cornfield\'s yield in two days. A locust is gonna scurry on around a lit match - he doesn\'t want to get burned. He knows when to compromise. He knows when to bend to get ahead. (pause)

> They all hesitate, but I know only a few that can verbally deny the necessity of change. It\'s the helplessness that I can\'t stand. It\'s pitiful. I\'m tired of being the prey.

TUCKER fiddles with his silverware for a beat.

> TUCKER

> Look\...My offer is big, but it\'s a one time deal. I can get you a season\'s supply of a few herbicides - for the whole community - and I don\'t even expect a return, necessarily. I just wanna see what happens. If your people aren\'t impressed by the results - by the numbers - then nothing can be done for them.

CLOSE ON ISAAC\'S FACE. He looks directly at us and smiles.

MONTAGE - VARIOUS

Tucker drives through the night. First through well-lit urban streets, then on deserted highways.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - EARLY MORNING (DARK)

Isaac walks from the diner, deeper and deeper into the glow of downtown.

He removes his smartphone from his pocket, taps the screen, and brings it to his ear.

INT. ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (DARK)

GABRIELA sits before a traditional Amish table. The kitchen is dark except for a single white wax candle burning next to a phone-shaped wooden block. She brings the block to her ear.

Only her face, the block, and her right hand holding it are visible in the candle\'s light.

> GABRIELA Yes, hello?

> ISAAC (O.S.)

> Gab, it\'s me. I just spoke with the

Isaac continues to walk briskly, eyes neurotically darting between each passer-by.

> You need to come home, Isaac.

> ISAAC

> (to the ground) Fuck.

Isaac lowers the phone from his ear and furiously TAPS the \"END CALL\" button with his finger.

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - THE NEXT DAY

The Cyber Purification Agency is headquartered in the basement of an average-looking suburban home. Tucker parks his car and approaches the door. On the keypad he enters:

\"42069\"

The door CLICKS open.

# CUT TO

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUOUS

The walls of the basement are covered with circuit boards and displays. A banner hangs with the SEAL of the CPA and the text:

CYBER PURIFICATION AGENCY

Beneath it, a large device marked \"IDENTITY AUTHORING UNIT\" sits next to a gigantic mound of electronics, paper stacks, and a desk.

In its chair is DRAKE, a twenty-something computer whiz kid wearing baggy jeans and a hoodie, MUMBLING incoherently to himself.

Young people in typical millennial collegiate clothing huddle in small plastic cubes (SYNERGY CAVES,) TYPING on laptops.

> TUCKER

> Plowed him\...All we gotta do now is plant the seeds.

> DRAKE

> Fuck him. These people are no threat to us\...Why not just end them and get it over with? They\'re helpless.
>
> TUCKER
>
> It\'s my operation. I\'ve done this before. I\'ll do it again.

Drake returns to TYPING.

After a beat, Tucker moves over his right shoulder to examine his screen.

# TUCKER (CONT\'D)

> DRAKE

> I\'ve been pressing phase three for an estimated timeframe for print source eradication\...They\'ve yet to give me anything. Could you talk to them?

Tucker leaves Drake\'s side and approaches the nearest agent.

> TUCKER

> Agent Mallard currently on assignment?
>
> AGENT \#1

> I think he went out for a smoke.

Tucker exits.

# CUT TO

EXT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Phil Mallard is smoking with another agent, leaning against THE SHED.

Tucker approaches from around the corner, walking casually across the backyard.

He reaches for the PISTOL in his waistband.

He CYCLES the slide, raises the barrel, and stops so that it rests 3 feet behind Mallard\'s head.

POP

Mallard\'s body falls forward.

Without hesitation, Tucker replaces the GUN in his waistband and dials \"911\" on his cell phone. With his free hand, he DRAGS Mallard\'s body toward the house.

# 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)

# 911 OPERATOR (O.S.)

> An officer will be there shortly.

> TUCKER Thank ya.

# CUT TO

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUOUS

Tucker ends the call as he DRAGS Mallard\'s body through the door.

He deposits it in a corner.

The staff watches as he begins to BREW a cup of coffee on a Keurig machine.

Their eyes fly between Tucker and Mallard\'s CORPSE as it

GARGLES and WHIRS.

Tucker\'s phone RINGS. He takes the filled cup and answers.

(pause)

> TUCKER I understand.

He ends the call, walks to Phil\'s body, frisks it, and produces a set of keys. He walks to the door and exits immediately.

EXT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUOUS Agent Mallard\'s Mercury Mariner is parked in the driveway. Tucker leaves the house and enters it.

The engine starts - it begins reversing.

# CUT TO

INT. MALLARD\'S MARINER - DAY - MOVING

Tucker is driving alone on a wide highway. Snow falls on the windshield. His face reflects mild discomfort.

He shifts in the seat.

MONTAGE - ISAAC\'S CAR

Isaac\'s car floats on secluded country roads, Isaac himself looking anxious.

EXT. ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A small farmhouse bordered by dark unknown. Its only illumination is dim candlelight through a window facing the gravel road.

Isaac\'s car crawls into the narrow lane, its headlights penetrating the darkness.

# CUT TO

INT. MONSANTO WORLD HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

A typical corporate meeting room with dreary, bare walls and white fluorescent lighting. It\'s dominated by a long black table surrounded by 11 office chairs. Five are on each side, and one is on the end, facing a large projector screen that covers the opposite wall. There are no other objects in the room save for a faded fake plant in one corner.

THE CEO of Monsanto leans against the wall next to the projector screen, moving little and watching Tucker (in an identical position opposite him.)

He\'s in his late fifties and balding. He speaks slowly and deliberately, with a heavy southern accent.

> CEO
>
> This is it bud.
>
> TUCKER
>
> I\'m still not sure why I\'m here.

> CEO
>
> These guys only hear ideas from me, most of the time. Ideas\...Talk. They\'re used to hearin\' a lot of talk. Tell ya the truth, they\'ve heard enough talk \'bout this, and it don\'t scare \'em. Now, ya see, you are the human manifestation of this entire plan. They\'ll take one look at you\... (grins)

> They\'ll piss themselves.

# CUT TO

INT. ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Isaac is eating dinner with his family. He sits at one end of a round walnut table, HIS FATHER on the other. Gabriela is on Isaac\'s right, opposite THEIR MOTHER. Two tall white candles burn on the table amidst an assortment of paper bags bearing the Taco Bell logo.

Isaac passes a soft taco to his mother.

> ISAAC
>
> (in his element)
>
> This is it. This is the opportunity
>
> I\'ve been waiting for. I have a willing ear in the most powerful organization in the world. I have to take it. YOU have to take it.

Gabriela looks at her mother\'s food. The parents remain in silence for a beat, unsure of how to respond.

> ISAAC\'S FATHER
>
> I thought you studied law, son.
>
> ISAAC
>
> Yes, that\'s how I met him.
>
> ISAAC\'S FATHER What can this man have to do with your schoolwork then? Is he in trouble?
>
> ISAAC

> No no, he\'s in too powerful a position with his company, and with the English by extension.
>
> ISAAC\'S FATHER
>
> Is his company in trouble, then?
>
> ISAAC
>
> No\...Well probably on a global scale, but no more than a company of its nature \'ought to be in.

Isaac\'s father devours another spoonful, looking puzzled.

INTERCUT between ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE and THE CONFERENCE

ROOM

The door opens and THE BOARD begins filing in and taking their seats.

The CEO stands upright and smiles, greeting each man appropriately.

They are all identical - balding banker-types. They kind that\'s found on Wall Street, except in cheaper suits.

Tucker stands, but remains in his corner, studying each face with interest.

Greetings are short between then; strict professionalism and an already present familiarity replace the usual idle conversation.

The CEO takes his position at the chairless end of the table and places both palms on it.

> CEO
>
> Gentlemen\...Why are you here?\...Why are WE here? (pause)
>
> Money! We\'re here to get rich.
>
> We\'re here to deliver the future of agriculture into human hands. We\'re here to save the world!

INTERCUT between THE CONFERENCE ROOM and ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S

HOUSE

> Written as if they apply to the whole planet. We\'re allowed to toy with differing from them, but only because it suits them. They find us entertaining. When our people grow strong again and spread - when our presence overcomes the container they have built for us, they will retaliate, believe me.

INTERCUT between ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE and THE CONFERENCE

ROOM

> CEO

> Our children will remember this. It may be unglorified now - lacks the glamour of silicon valley - but we are the celebrities and fresh minds of the future, my friends! As the population grows and the demand for food increases, and the diseases creep from the masses into the mansions of Malibu, we will be there with superfoods, cures, and repellants! There\'s one thing you can always be sure of.

> (pauses, already proud of himself for the punchline)
>
> As far and wide as man\'s mind is allowed to expand, as abstract and creative as his thoughts may become, as wealthy and powerful as he may get, he will ALWAYS have to eat.

The board is decidedly unaffected, neither bored nor impressed.

The CEO pauses to turn off the lights and trigger the projector.

A slide appears:

\"CYBER PURIFICATION AGENCY\"

> CEO (CONT\'D)
>
> Now, as I see it, we\'ve just about dealt with every obstacle in the way of our future utopia. We didn\'t scream when the punks were kickin\', so now they\'ve moved on to hatin\' the government, and the hippies are comin\' to see that nobody can afford their goddamned organic shit. There\'s only one people left that explicit and fundamentally oppose human progress\...The Amish.

His surprise is another\...Welcomed opportunity.

Isaac\'s father stops chewing for a moment. He looks wearily at his son.

> Right now, it\'s their people that grow in numbers and power. They need more and more land, more and more money, and soon they will begin to take ours. The only option for us is to do the same. If no one else is willing to sacrifice principle to save the entirety of our people, it will have to be me! If I am the only man in this family willing to protect it, then so be it! Shut your mouths, avert your gaze, and cower here because I WILL ACT!

Isaac SLAMS his silverware on the table and STOMPS out of the room.

# CUT TO

INT. MONSANTO WORLD HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Tucker is now presenting and The CEO has taken his corner.

The board is unanimously terrified: shaking, wide-eyed, and sweating as their eyes dart between Tucker and the slide he\'s discussing. It reads:

\"CULTURAL PURGE

1.  Phrases drafted in conjunction with behavioral psychologists placed in popular media to eradicate memory

2.  Computer specialists employed to erase all global electronic traces of the Amish, including online encyclopedias, social media, video streaming services, etc.

3.  Agents experienced in on-the-field espionage deployed in a worldwide covert operation to destroy any physical media of the same type\"

> TUCKER
>
> As you can imagine, the third phase is the most difficult undertaking of the whole operation, logistically. In my opinion, we need to consider bringing our completion date much closer. As the internet expands, the mess becomes larger and larger. The traces of TUCKER (CONT\'D)

# BOARD MEMBER \#2

> Obviously, for the cultural eradication to succeed, all citizens with connections to the Amish must be eliminated as well.

The CEO chuckles.

# FADE TO

INT. MONSANTO WORLD HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

The presentation has just concluded. The CEO moves from the corner to turn on the lights. He stops at Tucker\'s side and rests his right arm on his shoulders.

> CEO
>
> Well gentlemen, you know now that I have the right man for the job. I brought in Tucker when the green movement began gaining ground in the nineties. He brought in a fresh theory: these people that fetishize simplicity and ignorance, they come from all walks of life, and they pose a great threat to a species that requires technological and cultural momentum to survive. They must be stopped at all costs. He\'s my secret weapon. I put my faith in him, and you should too.
>
> (looks at watch, yawns)
>
> It\'s getting quite late, though.
>
> CEO (CONT\'D) I\'ll consider this meeting adjourned.

Every member of The Board begins yawning ferociously as they reach for their briefcases to leave.

They\'re still yawning as they get up, and one by one they notice that Tucker is the only one in the room not yawning.

He stands completely still, emotionless, looking straight forward with apathetic eyes.

They exit quickly now, running in terror like prey, still yawning, the CEO right behind them, smiling and yawning, leaving Tucker standing alone in the conference room as it darkens.

# FADE TO

INT. ISAAC\'S FAMILY\'S HOUSE - ISAAC\'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

(DARK)

Isaac\'s childhood room has only a rudimentary, uncomfortable bed, his open suitcase, two burning candles, and a Bible resting on top of a wooden nightstand.

Isaac lays on top of the blankets - still clothed - staring at the ceiling. His phone RINGS.

He answers.

> TUCKER (O.S.) How did it go?
>
> ISAAC
>
> To be honest, I don\'t feel like they\'re really my family anymore. Their weakness is stifling\...Disgusting.

EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING (DARK)

Tucker stands in an empty parking lot, his back to the wall of an office building.

> TUCKER

> It\'s fine. We expected this, right?
>
> You\'ve always known it could only be you.
>
> ISAAC

>
> TUCKER That\'s you.

Tucker pauses for a moment and listens.

TUCKER (CONT\'D) Look, if need be, we can try drafting a plan to apply the stuff covertly\...Something like that. It\'d give us a chance to prove it. INTERCUT between THE PARKING LOT and ISAAC\'S ROOM

> ISAAC

> That\'s a frightening thought.
>
> TUCKER (O.S.)
>
> That\'s your family talking.
>
> ISAAC You\'re right.
>
> TUCKER (O.S.)
>
> Okay, you\'ve got me. You have the support of the most powerful biochemical manufacturer on the planet. And families fight, you know. Even extreme philosophical differences can be simply\...Tossed aside. It\'s kinda what makes someone family.

> ISAAC

> Thanks man, you\'ve really helped. I\'ll talk some to the rest of the community tomorrow.

INTERCUT between ISAAC\'S ROOM and THE PARKING LOT Tucker ends the call and stares into the trees.

# FADE TO

INT. AMISH COMMUNITY CHURCH - DAY

The church is small, sparse, and very wooden. The laughter of children can be heard from outside, but the church itself is completely empty except for JOSEPH BOWES, who slouches in the third pew from the front with his head back, snoring lightly.

A YOUNG WOMAN approaches giddily and taps his head with a pew

Bible.

> YOUNG WOMAN Uncle Joe!

Uncle Joe awakens abruptly and looks at his niece with confusion.

> YOUNG WOMAN (CONT\'D) You really shouldn\'t sleep in church, you know.

Joseph MUMBLES inaudibly.

> YOUNG WOMAN (CONT\'D) Isaac\'s back. Gabriela was here first service talkin\' about the deal he\'s making with Monsanto. He\'s very worked up about it. Made friends with a man named Tucker.
>
> JOSEPH BOWES
>
> (more attentively now) What?
>
> YOUNG WOMAN
>
> (laughing)
>
> No, you\'re awake now. I\'ve done my job.

Joseph\'s niece kisses him on the cheek and skips away. He makes no attempt to recapture their conversation.

He pauses and stares ahead thoughtfully for a beat before rising from his pew.

# CUT TO

INT. JOSEPH BOWES\' RESIDENCE - THAT NIGHT

Joseph crouches in his cellar holding a single candle with his left hand, and digging through a small lockbox with his right.

He ruffles through several hand-written pages of diverse ages before he comes across a typed LETTER on stationary.

It\'s illegible except for the CPA SEAL and the sender\'s signature:

\"Tucker

VP, Community Relations

Monsanto Co.\"

# CUT TO

EXT. FIELD - LATER

The sky is clear, and the moon is bright, but only a large tree and Joseph Bowes are distinguishable from the horizon.

He maintains a slow pace across the soybean stubble, limping on his left leg.

A lone car\'s headlights appear around the corner.

As it SILENTLY approaches, it is apparent that Joseph will meet it as he crosses the road, so he pauses to let it pass. Instead, its approach slows as its headlights grow closer.

They stop, shining directly on Joseph; he can see nothing else.

A car door OPENS.

> TUCKER
>
> (yelling) Joseph Bowes?
>
> JOSEPH BOWES

> Who\'s th \--

A metallic WHISTLING ends Joseph\'s inquiry.

Seconds later, his body hits the ground.

THUD

# FADE TO

EXT. FIELD - DAY

In the light, the field is revealed to be a perfect river valley bordered by proud green bluffs. In the center, a magnificent and ancient bur oak spreads its branches.

Two police cars are parked parallel to one another on a private access road.

A group of lab technicians in white lab coats can be seen moving about inside a border of yellow tape, which flaps furiously in the wind. Another car approaches, this one unmarked.

It parks behind the originals and SPECIAL AGENT DON HAWKINS steps out, licking a huge lollipop in a black suit and aviators.

He stops, rests his right hand in his pocket, and slowly surveys the landscape as he continues to lick.

The BODY of Joseph Bowes lays on the ground, his face frozen in terror. It is physically untouched save for a perfectly circular two foot diameter hole in his abdomen.

Agent Hawkins slowly approaches an observing uniformed POLICE OFFICER.

> AGENT HAWKINS
>
> You ever seen anything like this?

# POLICE OFFICER ONE

> (without turning) They say we\'ve had stranger. I certainly haven\'t.

The officer turns now and immediately fixates on Don\'s lollipop.

> POLICE OFFICER ONE (CONT\'D) Who are you?
>
> AGENT HAWKINS (quickly shows badge)
>
> Special Agent Hawkins, FBI.

Don resumes his slow search - seemingly without direction - his eyes combing near and far, occasionally brushing the ground with his polished shoes.

LATER

Don\'s lollipop is nearly gone now. He returns to his car and retrieves a DSLR from the back seat, along with another lollipop.

He clamps it with his teeth as he takes photos of the crimescene.

# FADE TO

INT. DON\'S CAR - DUSK - MOVING Country plays on the radio. Don finishes a cigarette and reaches for his cell phone. He dials a number and brings it to his ear.

# CUT TO

INT. DON\'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Don\'s motel is a cheap, single-level unit with a remoteless TV and duck-themed comforter.

A POSTERBOARD hangs on an empty wall covered with a map, newspaper clippings, magazine photos, hand-written notes, and thumbtacks interconnected by red yarn. Phrases like \"School Shooting,\" \"Amish Hatecrimes,\" and \"Small Town Murder\" dominate the headlines.

On the table below is an open briefcase full of lollipops.

Don lounges, feet crossed on the bed facing the board, pouring himself a glass of whiskey.

Don smokes a cigarette and stares absentmindedly at the nearby highway, occasionally glancing at his phone.

# CUT TO

EXT. AMISH COMMUNITY - ELSEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

Don is wandering from house to house, knocking on each door, and intercepting anyone he encounters on the road between them.

He steps on the next porch and knocks. After a beat, an AMISH WOMAN opens the door. She has a filthy face and appears to be in her mid-twenties.

> AMISH WOMAN He\'s in the field.

Well then, what\'s your name? She SLAMS the door.

Don stares straight ahead for a beat before turning on his heels, starting for the next house on the road.

SAUL comes in frame from the right as he climbs the ditch, a five-gallon bucket of oats in his right hand. He\'s an Amish teen with a freckled face.

The outline of Tucker and Isaac can be seen in the distance, walking Don\'s way.

Agent Hawkins finishes writing in silence for a beat, then looks up. Both Tucker and Isaac stare blankly.

Don stares between them for a long while, waiting for something.

Don shakes hands with Isaac, then Tucker. HOLDING on Tucker\...

# FADE TO

INT. TUCKER\'S CAR - THAT NIGHT - MOVING Tucker is giving Isaac a ride back to the city.

They sit in silence. Tucker is concentrated on the road, Isaac stares out the window. The glow of streetlamps move rhythmically over their faces. Red and blue lights join them suddenly, dancing about the cabin.

Tucker\'s eyes move calmly to the speedometer.

Police sirens HOOT twice in quick succession.

> ISAAC Jesus.
>
> TUCKER
>
> (pulling over) Yup.

The car stops, Tucker moves the gear lever to Park, and reaches for the glovebox, but pauses and retreats.

A moment passes.

Isaac begins to grow agitated; he moves his hand to his face.

> ISAAC
>
> (confused, looking around the car)
>
> What the hell?!

Isaac\'s eyes come to rest on Tucker\'s pants, where a brown stain is forming.

POLICE OFFICER TWO approaches, Tucker\'s face quickly turns to anxiety and pain.

The cop\'s flashlight shines through the window as he rolls it down.

# POLICE OFFICER TWO

> How are you gentlemen ton -(hand flies to nose) Fuck!
>
> TUCKER
>
> (timidly)
>
> I\'m sorry I was going so fast officer\...I had an emergency\...I was just trying to get to the toilet.

Tucker looks down at his stained pants in simulated shame. The cop\'s eyes follow and widen.

# POLICE OFFICER TWO

> (stepping back) Jesus\...Just go!

Tucker engages a driving gear as the window rolls up.

He maintains his facade until the officer is a bit behind them, when it abruptly drops. Isaac still stares at him in disbelief for a beat.

> ISAAC

> Okay, what the fu \--

> These pants were cheaper than that ticket would\'a been.

(pause)

> ISAAC Dear god.

Tucker slows the car as it approaches their destination.

Isaac opens the door, exits, and looks back in for a moment, but says nothing.

Tucker gives him a polite nod as he SLAMS the door.

As the car accelerates back to speed, Tucker places a phone call.

> TUCKER
>
> Seven zero uniform november echo xray. I was intercepted a few hours ago in a compromised location. The situation required that I reveal my identity to an FBI agent, badge xray hotel alpha lima india alpha echo. Hawkins, Don. Special Agent. I need you to get on this immediately.

Tucker\'s driving even faster now. The tires SCREECH as he takes a tight bend.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Police officer two drives. His partner, POLICE OFFICER THREE rides in the passenger\'s seat.

Tucker\'s car enters their view, oversteering wildly, cutting them off.

> POLICE OFFICER THREE Shit.

> POLICE OFFICER TWO This guy again.

Three turns a knob, activating the cruiser\'s sirens and lights.

INTERCUT between THE POLICE CRUISER and TUCKER\'S CAR The lights flash in Tucker\'s rearview mirror. He slows the car and pulls over.

As the car stops, he produces an ASSAULT RIFLE from the backseat.

He exits the car and SPRAYS automatic fire at the two officers from his hip, killing them instantly. Tucker climbs back aboard and drives away. HOLDING ON his face\...

INT. COLLEGIATE LECTURE HALL - DAY

An empty (but lit) university lecture hall with no spectacular decoration. Students begin trickling in, then pouring.

After the last has entered, the room is noisy and chatty for beat before Drake walks in, CLOSING the door behind him - ending all conversation.

He sets his laptop bag on the teacher\'s desk and clears his throat.

> DRAKE
>
> I\'m sure everyone prepared for a pop quiz today\...

Uproar ensues.

Every student lurches out of their seat and throws any available loose objects toward the front of the room. One young man rips his laptop\'s screen from its body.

Another breaks the bundled software DVD in his textbook and begins devouring the pieces.

The students in the front row spit on Drake relentlessly.

# DRAKE (CONT\'D)

> Unfortunately, today I have something more important.

Abrupt SILENCE; the students are inexplicably back in their seats.

# DRAKE (CONT\'D)

Drake walks back to his desk, picks up a clipboard, and shows it to the crowd.

> DRAKE (CONT\'D)

> On your way out, I want you to fill out your contact information on this form. I\'ll review your transcripts, and call you if you\'re worth it. This is big guys. You\'re the best of the best, and I want you in on this. (shouting)

THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE erupts from the students. A standing ovation.

# FADE TO

EXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY

An empty state park on a cold spring day. It\'s surrounded by forest. A small playground is an island in the center of a flat grassy plain. Don\'s car is parked on the asphalt that cuts through it.

Don sits on a swing, licking a lollipop and moving slightly back and forth with his legs.

His phone RINGS.

He answers.

# CUT TO

INT. DIRECTOR STAFF\'S OFFICE - DAY

DIRECTOR STAFF is a slim redhead in her early forties. Her office is exactly as you\'d expect of someone of her rank. A small brass model of \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" holds pens on her desk. Pictures of her children adorn oak shelves along with a Detroit Lions foam hand.

She leans far back in her office chair and stares coldly at the wall.

> DIRECTOR STAFF The Bowes case has just been closed.

INTERCUT between DIRECTOR STAFF\'S OFFICE and the PUBLIC PARK Don ceases swinging and licking.

> AGENT HAWKINS What?

> DIRECTOR STAFF (O.S.) There\'s just not enough there, Don.

Director Staff is sitting up straight now, her fear overcoming her repulsion.

> You\'re out of line, Special Agent.

# AGENT HAWKINS (O.S.)

> Tell me, what piece of agricultural equipment used by this AMISH man could inflict such precise, deadly damage to him, and then vanish afterwards?

> Also, could you possibly explain, assuming you know of such an apparatus, why he was using it on a field MILES away from land owned by anyone he knew, much less himself?

(pause)

Director Staff looks at George Washington.

> DIRECTOR STAFF When\'s the last time you drank, Don?

INTERCUT between DIRECTOR STAFF\'S OFFICE and the PUBLIC PARK

Hawkins stops for a beat.

> AGENT HAWKINS

> At least three weeks ago, why?

The line CLICKS. Don checks his phone.

> AGENT HAWKINS (CONT\'D) Damnit.

He pivots on his heels to face his car in the distance, and sprints.

INT. ISAAC\'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Isaac\'s house is modern and brimming with fashionable, hand-made vintage decor and shining stainless steel appliances.

In the dining room, Tucker sits opposite him at a dark wood table, covered in fresh organic salad, raw milk, and free range steak.

In the low light, Isaac isn\'t noticing the reaction these fresh foods elicit from Tucker. His eyes tear, his nose starts to bleed, and he oscillates to such extreme angles that serious concentration is required to prevent him from falling out of his chair.

> ISAAC

Tucker rises quickly from his chair, reaching for his waistband.

> TUCKER Shit.

He brings the barrel of his GUN to bare on Isaac but totters about for a moment, dazed by his reaction to the organic foods.

POP

It\'s missed, and Isaac makes a quick break for the back door.

> ISAAC What the hell?!

Tucker follows as quickly as his condition will allow, holding onto the wall for support.

He reaches the door after much effort, but Isaac is nowhere to be found.

He leans on th door, GUN resting in one hand against his leg.

HOLDING on Tucker\...

# FADE TO

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - LATER

The CPA is busy. Drake is at his desk, MUMBLING to himself. The agents work silently on their computers.

Upon his arrival, Tucker\'s condition creates a stir among the staff. He stumbles through the door and promptly vomits on the floor.

After a beat, he continues across the room, breathing heavily and resting at every object along his path. He moves OFF SCREEN.

Glances are exchanged between the staff before he returns, carrying a jug of RoundUp and a syringe.

He rests on a desk, prepares the contraption, and injects the liquid into his arm. Immediately, he beings to relax.

> DRAKE
>
> I\'ve got something that\'ll make you feel better.

Tucker peaks first, then moves toward him. He looks over Drake\'s shoulder as he begins a Google search:

\"AMISH\"

He presses a key.

\"0 RESULTS FOUND\"

Tucker pats his back and begins to move away.

> DRAKE (CONT\'D) Wait. There\'s more.

Drake now manually enters a URL into the browser: \"HTTP://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG/WIKI/AMISH\"

\"LOADING\"

\"ERROR 404 - NOT FOUND\"

Tucker smiles.

After a beat, Drake pulls him slightly closer.

> DRAKE (CONT\'D)
>
> (softly)
>
> Phase two is now complete. I\'m told phase three will follow within the week.
>
> TUCKER Good.

Tucker stands up straight and hooks his fingers into his belt loops. He calmly scans the room for a beat.

> DRAKE
>
> There is one thing though\...You might want to say something to the team. For some reason, morale has been dropping. Our efficiency is starting to take a noticeable hit. We can\'t afford to let them sleep; we need to give them some platitudes to gnaw on.

Tucker nods and meanders towards the front of the room, looking from face to face. None of the agents stop their TYPING.

> TUCKER

> Look around you - tell me what you see.

Tucker begins walking slowly, looking directly at each agent as he passes them.

Tucker is still pacing and looking. Not a single individual diverts any attention from his/her work.

> TUCKER (CONT\'D) Today, we finish the work of our ancestors. This species we\'re part of - this community. Long has it struggled to be free of its doubters. We\'ve faced oddballs in all forms: critics, \"thinking men,\" leeches, and bygone lost souls.

Tucker moves rapidly to the wall, where the SEAL of the Cyber

Purification Agency hangs, and viciously stabs the Amish man\'s face with his finger.

> This is him! This is the prehistoric, anti-human vermin! This is the one who lives in a currencyless fantasy world and cunningly draws your kin in. He DARES reject us! This is what makes them so dangerous. They are Amish. We have to kill them. All of them.

Tucker stops and searches each face for a long while, each one unmoved.

Drake and Tucker make eye contact. Tucker nods.

Tucker leaves.

Immediately after the door closes, Drake turns to the room and releases a single SCREECH. All agents focus their attention on him and begin to form a line in front of the IDENTITY AUTHORING UNIT.

The first in line sits in the device. Drake connects his

External Neural Port to the IAU. It begins WHIRRING and BEEPING. The agent screams and succumbs to extreme spasms.

When the process is complete, Drake disconnects the agent. He moves near the door and stands at attention.

Each agent is processed in this way. Afterwards, they all move to a sequential spot in a growing line.

After the last agent has been processed, Drake again SCREECHES, sending the line single-file out the door.

Agents walk maniacally, threatening any that stand in their way.

EXT. AMISH COMMUNITY - DAY

MONTAGE - VARIOUS

1.  CPA agents flood into the Amish town on a busy planting day, terrorizing and creating chaos.

2.  CPA agents trip an elderly Amish woman. She falls to the ground, screaming. Agents pour Adderall and robitussin in a blender, and force feed her every ounce. Her screams intensify.

3.  A CPA agent drops a helmet on a loyalist, and begins controlling him with an R/C remote.

4.  An Amish man, late forties, is trapped on the ground by two CPA agents. He panics and screams. One retrieves an iPhone and holds it close to the man\'s face. On the screen, a slider reads: \"MICROWAVE EMISSIONS\"

The agent moves the slider to the most extreme, right through a dark red region labeled:

\"LETHAL\"

A loud CAPACITOR CHARGE sound is heard and the man\'s head explodes.

5.  A TED TALK is projected on the side of a farm house. Children run away, screaming in horror.

6.  A Ray William Johnson video is projected on one side of a barn, the other is spraypainted with segments of code.

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - NIGHT

The CPA is quiet and dark. The agents are working diligently and Drake MUMBLES at his desk.

One by one, the occupying agents are removed OFF SCREEN by a dark, hidden figure. The last agent falls.

Drake looks straight ahead, wide-eyed, unmoving. Behind him, the figure creeps closer. It comes into the light, revealing Isaac\'s face.

EXT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - THE NEXT DAY

Don Hawkins arrives in his car. He pause by it for moment and licks the lollipop in his left hand. In his right is his smartphone, which displays a satellite map. A red pin is marked with the CPA seal and text: \"CYBER PURIFICATION AGENCY\"

He holsters his phone and approaches the door slowly, scanning in all directions as he walks.

He stops at the door and retrieves his GUN from his shoulder holster.

He holds it at the ready as he turns the doorknob slowly.

INT. CPA BASE OF OPERATIONS - CONTINUOUS

Biological ruin. The bodies of the CPA agents lie scattered about; none are recognizable. The electrical equipment is still functioning. It HUMS. The synergy caves are stained with blood.

> FBI! Put your hands in the air!

After a beat, the agent looks directly at Don and lowers into a brawling stance.

Don pauses. He throws his GUN behind him.

The two clash.

The agent clearly has the advantage.

In the midst of fighting, Don finds a MACHETE in the shed and finishes him with it.

Still on Tucker, the audio from Isaac\'s phone changes dramatically. A microcassette voice recorder plays for several minutes. From the recording, we hear only the sound of wind and the microphone RUBBING against clothing. This is mixed with occasional muttering from Isaac, POPS from the \"fast-forward\" and \"play\" buttons, and the soft mechanical

WHIRRING of the player fast-forwarding. Tucker continues to look straight forward, unmoving save for regular sips of gasoline.

Opposing him, on the other side of the expanse, a small army of CPA agents forms a protective cluster around Tucker. First, Isaac breaks through the line.

Tucker and Isaac shoot nonstop at each other as they travel through fields, parking lots, suburbs, and warehouses. Tucker retreats, Isaac pursues.

Tucker emerges from around the corner of a large building, driving a COMBINE HARVESTER.

The REEL spins and razor sharp KNIVES become a blur from their rapid reciprocation. He turns the contraption to face Isaac and it quickens. CLOSE ON IN-CABIN SEATBELT SAFETY GRAPHIC

Tucker\'s elbow knocks the velocity control to 0, sending him flying through the windshield.

He tumbles, barely clearing the HEADER and its horrors, but he lands on Isaac\'s pitchfork.

Isaac holds eye contact with Tucker as he bleeds for a beat before lifting him up by the handle and delivering him to be devoured by the machine.

CLOSE ON IN-HOPPER AUGER, under no load for a beat. It begins to SPEW blood.

What\'s left of Tucker - mostly skin - is expelled from the rear of the machine.

Isaac produces the CPA BANNER and wraps TUCKER\'S REMAINS in it.

He drags them OFF SCREEN.

# CUT TO

EXT. THE LAKEBED - LATER

Isaac returns - still dragging the bundle - to find more CPA agents amassed on the lakebed, advancing very slowly toward the Amish crowd.

With hate, Isaac unleashes upon the group, mowing them down as quickly as he can. The last agent falls.

For a beat, Isaac scans the battlefield.

He turns around to find Gabriela and the Amish staring at him like cornered animals - all in shock.

He looks into each pair of disgusted, terrified eyes with greater and greater sadness. Then, greater and greater anger. At last, he begins to bring his SHOTGUN to a ready position. CUT TO BLACK before it reaches his shoulder.

THE END
