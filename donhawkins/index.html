<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">FBI agent&nbsp;
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Has good intentions toward the Amish...but is fought by FBI superiors (who are being paid off by Monsanto.)<br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><b>Inspired by/Stolen from:</b>
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Leroy Jethro Gibbs (NCIS)
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">From Gibbs comes his military mindset, attitude, and sense of duty and honor, except he's even more the cliche salty patriotic american suit-wearing hero in that he had a fairly good relationship with his father (better than Gibbs anyway,) and is in a relatively "successful" marriage. &nbsp;The interesting thing about Don is his early-onset saltiness.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Whereas Gibbs is in his 50s in NCIS and has that post-human relationships attitude, Hawkins is young, but equally serene. &nbsp;
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Gibbs is also the head of a department, but Hawkins is a "lone wolf" when it comes to work. &nbsp;He's isolated from, (but still highly respected by) the individuals he works with in the FBI. &nbsp;He still works for somebody...it's still the first half of his career, but he acts like he's at retirement age.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><b>What does Don want?&nbsp;</b>
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><b>&nbsp;</b>Children/family, make the world a little safer. Don's Utopia: America, with a little less violence&nbsp;
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Don is likable, moderate. &nbsp;He wants the world to be "just a little more reasonable."
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Don is the kinda guy who generally thinks "people need more common sense."
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">This is Don's public profile, but he is actually quite intelligent.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Don was the "anything goes" kinda guy in his youth. &nbsp;Now, he's less open minded, but only reacts to concepts he doesn't understand with confusion, not anger.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">(I.E. Don would probably lean towards the right with his fundamental belief in the family as the foundation of American life, but he wouldn't have a personal problem with the Christian controversial topics ((gay marriage, drugs, abortion.)))
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Don has an inherent respect for anything old and American...he lives internally in the 60s.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Don believes the 60s American Dream is the best path a man could follow...but he generally isn't bothered by people who deviate from his ideas.&nbsp;
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Don was the youngest of three kids. &nbsp;He grew up in Northern Illinois...hunted deer with his dad at 8 years old.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Has that salty federal agent vibe...concealed emotions, very tactical dude, with a deep-rooted sense of military behavior and a sense of honor.
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">-Don is the kind of guy that resolves a conflict with a handshake. (A man's man, if you will.)
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><br />
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; "><b>DON'S POSITION ON AMISH HATECRIMES</b>
</div>
<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; ">Don loves America, and he see's the Amish as integral to the American landscape. &nbsp;He's "in it" to preserve American values, and he identifies with the hard-working nature of the Amish people. &nbsp;Of course, Don would defend any American citizen...his oaths to the country are a matter of honor to him...but has a special interest in the wellbeing of the Amish because of his rural upbringing.
